      <p class="first">This happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling. About twelve o'clock a
         troop
         of ten or
         twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to clear the
         way with its cow–catcher; but the mass of animals was too great. The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil
         gait, uttering now and then deafening bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a
         particular direction, nothing can moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no
         dam could contain.</p>
      <p> The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who had the most reason
         of all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should please the buffaloes
         to get out of the way. Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his
         arsenal of revolvers upon them.</p>
      <p> "What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession, just as if they were not
         impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme! And here's an
         engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts!"</p>
